    <h1>Poor waste disposal</h1>
    <p>Environmental degradation, soil contamination, and water pollution are 
        direct outcomes of poor waste disposal, harming ecosystems. 
        Additionally, improper waste disposal poses severe health risks,
         spreading diseases and compromising air quality.
          It's time to prioritize responsible waste management 
          for the well-being of both our planet and ourselves.</p>
